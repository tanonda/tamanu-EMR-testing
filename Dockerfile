## Base images
# The general concept is to build in build-base, then copy into a slimmer run-base
FROM node:20-alpine AS base
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json COPYRIGHT LICENSE-GPL LICENSE-BSL ./

FROM base AS build-base
RUN apk add --no-cache \
    --virtual .build-deps \
    bash \
    g++ \
    gcc \
    git \
    jq \
    make \

COPY common.* ./
COPY scripts/ scripts/

FROM base AS run-base
ENV NODE_ENV=production
RUN apk add --no-cache bash curl jq
# set the runtime options
COPY scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh /entrypoint
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint"]
CMD ["serve"]


## Build the target server
FROM build-base AS build-server
ARG PACKAGE_PATH

# copy all packages
COPY packages/ packages/

# do the build, which will also reduce to just the target package
RUN scripts/docker-build.sh ${PACKAGE_PATH}
RUN npm prune --production


## Normal final target for servers
FROM run-base AS server
# restart from a fresh base without the build tools
ARG PACKAGE_PATH
# FROM resets the ARGs, so we need to redeclare it

# copy the built packages and their deps
COPY --from=build-server /app/packages/ packages/
COPY --from=build-server /app/node_modules/ node_modules/
COPY alerts alerts/

# set the working directory, which is where the entrypoint will run
WORKDIR /app/packages/${PACKAGE_PATH}

# explicitly configure the port
ENV PORT=3000
EXPOSE 3000

# read configuration from source and from /config
#
# NOTE: We also explicitly set this value in central-server/pm2.config.cjs for when running in production
# but the two values should resolve to the same path
ENV NODE_CONFIG_DIR=/config:/app/packages/${PACKAGE_PATH}/config


## Build the frontend
FROM build-base AS build-frontend
RUN apk add zstd brotli
COPY packages/ packages/
RUN scripts/docker-build.sh web


## Minimal image to serve the frontend
FROM alpine AS frontend
